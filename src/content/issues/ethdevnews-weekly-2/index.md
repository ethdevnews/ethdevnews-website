The Su Squares NFT project from 2018 is a demonstration of how NFTs can be used for things other than profile photos.

Cute 10Ã—10 pixel squares that you own and personalize. On-chain. Still minting.

Created by Su & William Entriken, lead author of the ERC-721 document. We are proud to sponsor abcoathup and this pioneering ethdevnews project, keep it up!
