And just like that, ethdevnews limited run has come to an end.

Unfortunately, I haven't been able to secure grant funding and am [out of runway](https://x.com/abcoathup/status/1963576166586937706).

Thank you to all the subscribers and everyone who shared, liked & reposted the newsletter.  I appreciate you.

Massive thanks to [Su Squares](https://tenthousandsu.com) ([@SuSquares](https://x.com/susquares) & [@fulldecent](https://x.com/fulldecent)) for sponsoring issue [#2](../ethdevnews-weekly-2/) and extending the run by an extra week.  Thanks also to [90 seconds to crypto](https://x.com/haochizzle) for using paid listings.

Finally, thanks to [Evan Van Ness](https://x.com/evan_van_ness) & [Week in Ethereum News](https://weekinethereumnews.com) for setting the standard for curated Ethereum developer news.  I was a huge fan and loved my 3.5 years editing WiEN.  ethdevnews stands on the shoulders of this giant.

Hopefully ethdevnews can come back for a season 2, but it's goodbye for now.

P.S. I am looking for fulltime paid work.  [DM](https://x.com/abcoathup) to chat.
